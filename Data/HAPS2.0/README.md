### HAPS Dataset 2.0

In real-world scenarios, human motion typically adapts and interacts with the surrounding region. The proposed **Human Activity and Pose Simulation (HAPS) Dataset 2.0** improves upon [**HAPS 1.0**](https://github.com/lpercc/HA3D_simulator/) by making the following enhancements:  
1. *Refining and diversifying human motions.*  
2. *Providing descriptions closely tied to region awareness.*   

HAPS 2.0 mitigates the limitations of existing human motion datasets by identifying **26 distinct regions** across **90 architectural scenes** and generating **486 human activity descriptions**, encompassing both **indoor and outdoor environments**. These descriptions, validated through **human surveys** and **quality control using ChatGPT-4**, include realistic actions and region annotations (e.g., *"workout gym exercise: An individual running on a treadmill"*).

The [**Motion Diffusion Model (MDM)**](https://guytevet.github.io/mdm-page/) converts these descriptions into **486 detailed 3D human motion models** $\mathbf{H}$[^1] using the **SMPL model**, each transformed into a **120-frame motion sequence** $\mathcal{H}$.  

Each **120-frame SMPL mesh sequence** $\mathcal{H} = \langle h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_{120} \rangle$ details **3D human motion and shape information** through the **SMPL model**.
